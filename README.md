# RadViz
RadViz is radial visualization method for displaying high-dimensional data in two-dimensnional space[[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/663916). This program is in JavaScript and only depend on [d3.js library](https://github.com/d3). A screenshot of this implementation is shown below. Based on RadViz, I designed a radial distortion method, [PolarViz](https://github.com/WYanChao/PolarViz). Another implementation of RadViz based on [d3.js library](https://github.com/d3) can be found [here](https://github.com/biovisualize/radviz) by [Chris Viau](https://github.com/biovisualize).

# About the Code
* 'Index.html' defines the DOM components used in the RadViz function.
* 'Index.js' loads the high-dimensional dataset, defines the five variables used in the RadViz function, and calls the RadViz function.
* 'RadViz.js' defines the RadViz function.
* In the data file, I use the 'IRIS' dataset as an example to call the RadViz function.
